# Temple TV — Build .aab with Android Studio

> **DEPRECATED — use EAS Build instead.**
>
> This guide describes the legacy local Android Studio build workflow.
> It requires local Android Studio, Java, Gradle, and manual keystore management.
>
> **The canonical production build method is EAS Build** — it requires no local Android toolchain,
> manages the signing keystore securely in Expo's cloud infrastructure, and is the only method
> that should be used for new Play Store releases.
>
> See **[ANDROID_BUILD_GUIDE.md](./ANDROID_BUILD_GUIDE.md)** for the current EAS-based workflow.
>
> This file is kept for reference only. If you are setting up a fresh production release,
> stop here and follow `ANDROID_BUILD_GUIDE.md` instead.

> Generates the Google Play-ready `app-release.aab` using Android Studio on your machine.
> Everything in the `android/` folder is already pre-configured — you only need to
> create your signing keystore, then click Build.

## What you need (one-time install)
- **Android Studio** (any recent version): https://developer.android.com/studio
- **Java 17+** — bundled with Android Studio, no separate install needed

---

## Step 1 — Generate your release keystore

On **Mac / Linux** — run from the `artifacts/mobile/` folder:
```bash
bash scripts/generate-keystore.sh
```

On **Windows** — double-click `scripts\generate-keystore.bat`

This creates two files inside `android/`:
- `temple-tv-release.keystore` — your signing key
- `keystore.properties` — the passwords (auto-read by Gradle)

> **Back both files up somewhere safe** (USB drive, 1Password, encrypted cloud).
> If you lose them you cannot publish future updates to the same Play Store listing.

---

## Step 2 — One-shot Android setup

Run this from the `artifacts/mobile/` folder:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-local-properties.sh
```

This single script does **everything** needed to make the project Android-Studio-ready:

1. **Generates `android/`** via `expo prebuild --platform android --no-install` if the folder
   is missing (fresh clone). On subsequent runs, it skips this step.
2. **Writes `android/local.properties`** with the detected Android SDK path. It checks common
   locations (`~/Android/Sdk`, `$ANDROID_HOME`, `~/Library/Android/sdk`, etc.). If it can't
   find the SDK it asks you for the path — you can find it in Android Studio under
   **File → Project Structure → SDK Location**.
3. **Chains into `scripts/check-node-path.sh`**, which detects your `node` binary and offers
   to pin its absolute path into `android/gradle.properties` (so Android Studio launched from
   a desktop icon — which doesn't inherit your shell `PATH` — can still find it during the
   build). Just answer `y` when prompted.

## Step 3 — Open the project in Android Studio

### On Linux — use the launcher script (recommended)

Linux desktop launchers (`.desktop` files in GNOME/KDE/etc.) **do not** source your
shell rc files, so Android Studio launched from the icon won't see `node` from
`nvm` / `asdf` / `fnm` and Gradle will fail with `command 'node' error=2`. To avoid
that, launch Android Studio with this script:

```bash
bash artifacts/mobile/scripts/launch-android-studio.sh
```

It sources `~/.profile`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, plus `nvm`, `asdf`, and `fnm` init
scripts; then locates `studio.sh` in common install paths (`~/android-studio/`,
`/opt/android-studio/`, JetBrains Toolbox, Snap) and starts Android Studio in the
background with `node` on PATH and your `android/` folder pre-opened.

### On macOS / Windows — open normally

1. Launch Android Studio
2. Click **Open** (not "New Project")
3. Navigate to and select the **`artifacts/mobile/android/`** folder
4. Wait for Gradle sync to finish (first time: 5–15 min while it downloads SDKs)

If Android Studio asks to upgrade the Gradle plugin — click **Don't remind me again**.

---

## Step 4 — Build the signed .aab

### Option A — Command line (fastest, no IDE needed)

From the `artifacts/mobile/` folder:

```bash
pnpm run build:android         # produces a signed .aab
pnpm run build:android:apk     # produces a signed .apk (for sideload testing)
```

The `.aab` lands at `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`.

Other helpers:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pnpm run android:prebuild` | Regenerate `android/` from `app.json` after a versionCode bump |
| `pnpm run android:setup` | One-shot SDK + node path setup (delegates to the scripts) |
| `pnpm run android:clean` | `./gradlew clean` — clear stale build outputs |
| `pnpm run android:stop` | Stop the Gradle daemon (use after PATH/env changes) |

### Option B — Android Studio GUI

1. In the menu bar: **Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK…**
2. Select **Android App Bundle** → click **Next**
3. Click **Choose existing…** and select `android/temple-tv-release.keystore`
4. Enter the passwords you set in Step 1
5. Key alias: `temple-tv-key`
6. Tick **Remember passwords**
7. Click **Next**
8. Select build variant: **release**
9. Click **Create**

Android Studio bundles the JS (Metro), compiles the native code (Gradle + R8),
signs the binary, and saves the file to:

```
artifacts/mobile/android/app/release/app-release.aab
```

Build time: ~10–20 minutes on first run (subsequent builds are faster).

## Step 5 — Upload to Google Play

1. Go to https://play.google.com/console
2. Create a new app (package: `com.templetv.app`)
3. Go to **Testing → Internal testing** → Create new release
4. Upload `app-release.aab`
5. Add release notes and roll out

---

## Environment variables

The production API URL (`https://api.templetv.org.ng`) is already set in
`.env.production` — Metro reads this automatically during the JS bundle step.
No manual configuration needed.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Gradle sync fails: `SDK not found` | Run `bash scripts/setup-local-properties.sh` first, or set `sdk.dir` in `android/local.properties` manually |
| `keytool not found` | keytool comes with Java. Open Android Studio terminal — it has Java in PATH |
| Build fails: `Duplicate class` | In Android Studio terminal: `./gradlew clean` then rebuild |
| `minSdkVersion` mismatch | No action needed — already set to 24 (Android 7) |
| `.aab` not found after build | Check `android/app/release/` or `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/` |
| `A problem occurred starting process 'command 'node''` / `Cause: error=2, No such file or directory` | Android Studio (launched from the desktop icon) doesn't inherit your shell's `PATH`, so Gradle can't find `node`. **Fix (pick one):** (1) **Easiest:** quit Android Studio, then launch it from a terminal (`studio.sh` on Linux, `open -a "Android Studio"` on macOS) so it inherits your shell PATH. (2) Run `bash scripts/check-node-path.sh` from `artifacts/mobile/` — it detects your `node` path and offers to write `nodeExecutableAndArgs=...` into `android/gradle.properties` for you. (3) Symlink node into a system path: `sudo ln -s "$(which node)" /usr/local/bin/node`. After any of these, in Android Studio: **File → Invalidate Caches → Invalidate and Restart**, then rebuild. |

---

## Subsequent releases

For every new release:
1. Bump `"version"` in `app.json` (e.g. `"1.1.0"`)
2. Bump `"versionCode"` in `app.json` by 1 (e.g. `3`)
3. Run `pnpm expo prebuild --platform android --no-install` again from `artifacts/mobile/`
4. Rebuild in Android Studio
